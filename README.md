## 🔧 Key Features Explained

### Reverse Calculation Magic
The calculator intelligently detects which values you've entered and automatically calculates all missing properties. For example:
- **Cylinder**: Enter radius and height → get volume and TSA
- **Ohm's Law**: Enter voltage and current → get resistance
- **Kinetic Energy**: Enter mass and velocity → get energy

### Pi Value Flexibility
Toggle between precise values:
- **22/7**: Better for fractional calculations
- **3.14**: Standard decimal approximation

## 🎯 Supported Calculations

### Physics Formulas
- Speed, Force, Pressure, Work, Power, Density
- Kinetic Energy, Potential Energy, Momentum
- Acceleration, Newton's Second Law
- Ohm's Law, Electrical Power
- Gravitational Force

### Mensuration Shapes
**2D**: Square, Rectangle, Circle, Triangle  
**3D**: Cube, Cuboid, Cylinder, Sphere, Cone  
**Hollow**: Hollow Cylinder, Hollow Cone, Hollow Hemisphere  
**Special**: Hemisphere with CSA/TSA calculations

## 🌟 Unique Features
